            <h2>Woah I made a website; somebody hire me</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>The first time I built a portfolio site from scratch involved heavy use of Adobe Creative Suite, specifically Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Illustrator.</p>
            <p>Now, the industry landscape is insane such that a fair amount of this site at the time of this writing was accomplished in ~3 weeks ü¶• by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>lightly designing in Figma</li>
                    <li>alternating between Cursor, VS Code, and ChatGPT</li>
                    <li>debugging with Firefox and Chrome's developer tools, and</li>
                    <li>using conscientious ‚ú® CSS ‚ú®, quite surprisingly</li>
                </ul>
            <p>That said, much of the coding was <em>definitely not</em> simply vibing. The challenge with going DIY was running into problems where solutions were not obvious. Sure, this code block works just fine elsewhere, but how do I make it work for this use case or that content? Also, the type scales still need more fiddling.</p>
            <p>In an era where many portfolios lean on Webflow, Framer, Squarespace, and the like - not to mention the tandem urgency of my job search üíÄ - I was swayed to sweat through creating something that spoke more to my own style.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Devil in the Details</h3>
            <p>Some details that went into this project include:</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Glitchy-esque svg filters thanks to <a href="https://css-doodle.com/" target="_blank">CSS Doodle</a> üñåÔ∏è</li>
                <li>Animations like <a href="https://github.com/adryd325/oneko.js/blob/main/oneko.js" target="_blank">Oneko.js</a> üêà</li>
                <li>Project panes inspired by <a href="https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/XJWNMOO" target="_blank">Jhey</a> üç±</li>
                <li>Typography from <a href="https://vj-type.com/16-dahlia" target="_blank">VJ Type</a> ‚öúÔ∏è</li>
                <li><a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">FFmpeg</a> for video compression and conversion üìΩÔ∏è</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>The more onerous web development tasks included nailing the responsive stylings and addressing cross-browser compatibility. The light/dark mode toggle is for some reason <strong> M A S S I V E </strong> on Safari. Tragically, I'm not good at everything.</p>
            <p>The more enjoyable tasks involved image and video assets, animations, and interactions such as the project panes and glitchy texts. There's certainly an affinity for work that provides rapid multi-sensory feedback (visuals, audio, tactile textures, timing... that sort of thing)</p>
            <p>I would have loved to illustrate some assets but publishing this ding dong thing sooner was a bigger urgency.</p>
            <p>If you're a hiring manager or recruiter and you like what you see, please reach out. Shampooing carpets as a side hustle AIN'T CUTE.</p>
